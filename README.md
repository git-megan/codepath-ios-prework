# Prework - *The Color Changing App*
Prework for iOS development workshop by Codepath

Submitted by: **Megan Brown**

**The Color Changing App** is an app that changes its background color when a user clicks the 'Change Color' button.

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total
I learned a bit about Swift as a language, and then created my first iOS app where I learned how to create UI and connect the UI to code that allows the app to function.

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Below are some ideas of iOS apps I could make and features I could work on to further my learning of iOS development.

### Singing Practice App
This app would allow singers to more easily practice their warm-ups and songs they are working on at home. Possible features:
* Vocal Warm-up: Play a recording of musical scales, so the singer can sing along to warm up their voice.
* Notes: Write down your notes on what to focus on this week, and write down the lyrics to songs you are working on.
* Record Yourself: Record yourself singing, so you can listen back to the recording and make notes on which areas to focus on for improvement.
* Train Your Ear: Listen to a pre-recorded chord or sequence of notes, and be quizzed on what musical pattern you are hearing (e.g. Listen to two notes - Is this a Major 7th?). The quiz will be multiple choice and will share the correct answer once the user selects their guess.

### Yoga Routine App
This app would allow yogis to more easily plan their next yoga routine. Features could include:
* Build a Routine: Choose from a collection of yoga poses, and build a yoga routine for yourself, dragging and dropping the poses you want into the order that you'd like.
* Guided Yoga: Select a routine you've created and press play. This will guide you through a full yoga sequence with a voice that walks you through the yoga poses.
* Background Music: Select background music to play at the same time as your yoga routine.
* Yoga Timer: Set a timer, such as a 15-minute timer with a pleasant gong or chime sound at the end. This allows yogis to do free-form yoga without needing a routine for a set amount of time.
* Share: Share your routine with friends by pressing a button that sends your routine (with the sequence of poses written out in order) via text or email.

### Drawing Workout
This app is created for people who want to improve their drawing skills by working on quick sketches on a regular basis.
* Get a Drawing Prompt: Press a button to get a random drawing prompt. It will then give you a short prompt of what to draw (e.g. Draw a basket of fruit in a realistic style).
* Save Your Progress: See how much progress you have made over time, by uploading your finished sketch to your collection of sketches you've completed. Look back at your previous work and progress.
* Set a Pomodoro Timer: Set a pomodoro timer to encourage yourself to finish the sketch in a certain amount of time, and not get stuck.
* Challenge a Friend: Share the same drawing prompt with your friend, and complete the drawing in the same amount of time. Then share your work with your friend and see what you both have created.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
